Having a detailed budget of the resources and skills needed for the project and continously monitor the project. 

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology has a flexible approach to the completion of projects while Waterfall is linear and has predictable outcomes.

Waterfall methodology
Advantages:
* Clear structure and predictable timeline
* Has a well defined and detailed plan.
* It encourages thorough documentation.

Disadvantages:
* Has a lack of flexibility and difficulty to adapt to changes.
* High potential for delaus and higher costs due to flexibility.
* Not suitable for dynamic or complex projects.

Agile methodology
Advantages:
* Changes to projects can be made at later stages of development. 
* There is frequent interaction with the client to ansure a match of the final project with the client's expectations.
* Helps better manage and identify risks by dealing with them throughou the stages of the development.

Disadvantage:
* Can be less predictable and harder to manage scope and costs.
*Takes up a lot of tine ue to constant feedback and chnages.
* Requires strong team communcation.
